I'm an experienced software engineer focused on building cloud-based web services through strong technical leadership, design, and implementation. I enjoy enabling technical growth through innovation and new technologies while delivering software that empowers customers.

My system administration background and technical curiosity have helped me to better understand the development, deployment, and operations aspects of shipping products.

I'm currently working on a the [Data Axle Platform](https://platform.data-axle.com) ingesting sources of data, cleaning it up, merging it together, and providing it to our customers via files or via APIs in real-time.
