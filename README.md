I'm an experienced software engineer focused on building cloud-based web services through strong technical leadership, design, and implementation. I enjoy enabling technical growth through innovation and new technologies while delivering software that empowers customers.

My system administration background and technical curiosity have helped me to better understand the development, deployment, and operations aspects of shipping products.

I'm currently working at [Stitch Fix](https://stitchfix.com) building the PaaS that runs the company's applications.
